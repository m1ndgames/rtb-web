          <h3>General Rules</h3>
          Bot authors must ensure that their creations are not harming the ladder system in any way, including but not limited to:<br><br>
          <li>Slowing down the system on purpose</li>
          <li>Generating huge amounts of data on the disc without purpose</li>
          <li>Tempering with the filesystem or memory</li>
          <li>Network access of any kind besides connecting to the local sc2api process is strictly forbidden</li>
          <li>Uploading copies (clones) of another bot is forbidden</li>

          <h3>Bot Development</h3>
          The Ladder supports currently Python 3.6<br>
          To make sure the bot is accepted by the ladder you must follow the following standards:<br>

          <br>
          <b>Python:</b>
          <li>Python 3.6</li>
          <li>pysc2 - latest pip version (updated every midnight)</li>
          <li>python-sc2 - latest git master (updated every midnight)</li>
          <li>Bot called via run.py</li>
          <a href="/downloads/python-example-bot.zip">Download</a> example Bot.

          <br>
          <br>
          For a successful upload the Bot must be packed using zip. (Max 10 MB)
          <br>
          The bots may write to a ./data directory, this data can be downloaded via profile page.
          <br>

          <h3>Security</h3>
          The Ladder is completely automated and in theory attacks are quite simple to achieve. To counter this the games are played on seperated LadderServers which are firewalled
          and reset themselves after every game.
          <br>
          Network access is denied and will lead to a permanent ban from the ladder.
          <br>
          The training data is stored on another server will be fetched before a bot plays a new game.

          <h3>Match Queue</h3>
          The match queue makes sure all Bots have to play against every other bot on the ladder. If the queue is empty a fresh one is generated containing all active bots. (Round-Robin)
